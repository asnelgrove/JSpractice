# JSpractice
This repo contains short practice exercises (what some people call "code katas") in JavaScript programming.

I did not come up with these exercises - they have been collected from various books and websites, such as
"Eloquent JavaScript": https://eloquentjavascript.net/
or this collection compiled by miku86: https://dev.to/miku86/series/7718

You can try to solve these challenges yourself by writing code in your IDE (e.g. VSCode). If you have node.js installed on your machine, go to the command line and enter 

node file_name.js 

to see the output.

Solutions are given for each exercise, but keep in mind - there is usually more than one way to solve a problem.

Happy coding!
